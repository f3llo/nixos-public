# nixos-public

This is a repository containing all of the configurations for my current desktop. If you haven't yet, consider getting into NixOS, it is worth it (maybe).

Please be aware that I have removed some identifying information from the configuration so whenever you see ```NOPE```, you will have to replace that information to make the configuration functional.

At the moment my configuration is very minimal. This is the most simple way that I get my work done. Because of this the configuration follows a **very** utalitarian approach.

Regardless, the configuration is always changing, so if I ever get bored I guess this would be the first thing on the table. 

Additionally, I might add comments to the code to make it easy to understand for anyone brand new to NixOS. My biggest annoyance just getting started was the complexity of different configurations and a somewhat cryptic wiki (and subsequently being too afraid to ask discouse and waste their time, who are really nice btw). Hopefully I can help someone and save them half a day of searching. Then again, I am not a linux veteran, so take bad practice with a grain of salt.
